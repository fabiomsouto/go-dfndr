# Go Defender

Inspired by an early eighties arcade game, Defender.

I've wanted to train and expand my Golang skills a bit while exploring games.
It's a fun game to code during crappy weather!

Have fun.

## Internals

Used [ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) to help speed development. It's got lots of nice examples and support for the basic things a game requires.


## How to play

```

## Objective

Help Captain Gopher kill all the issues that plague the software universe!

### Memleaks

Their evil and unpredictable nature are a constant threat! Kill them before they kill you!
